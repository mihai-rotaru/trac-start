Two ways of starting multiple environments:
- as a service
- simply running tracd

Why not simply use tracd ?
--------------------------
It is a matter of taste, mostly; I preffer using a script since I have many trac environments,
and I need a flexible way of starting/restarting tracd - standard or as a service.

Need a script to:
- look in a specified file
- each line of the file represents the path to a trac env
- check if folder exists, and is trac env
- add it to the list of env's to be passed as a parameter to tracd
- construct the arguments to pass to nssm
    ex: 
    nssm install Tracs C:\Python26\Scripts\tracd-script.py "<generated env list>"
- if the Tracs service is already running, restart it
- manage lists with envs:
    - active
    - all
